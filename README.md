# ComposePlayground
This repository serves as a personal project to track my progress in learning and experimenting with [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) for Android development.


## Project Overview

Jetpack Compose is Android's modern toolkit for building native UI with declarative programming.
This project is designed to track my progress as I learn how to build Android user interfaces using Jetpack Compose.
Through a series of small projects, examples, and experiments, I aim to deepen my understanding of this powerful UI toolkit.

The goal is to build a foundational knowledge of Compose, focusing on its core components, state management, theming, animations, and integration with Android's architecture components.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the core principles of Jetpack Compose.
- Implement reusable components with Compose.
- Manage state efficiently within a Compose UI.
- Explore navigation patterns using Compose's Navigation library.
- Learn theming and styling with Material Design 3 and Compose.
- Build complex layouts and animations declaratively.
- Integrate Compose with ViewModels, LiveData, and other architecture components.

## Features

The repository is structured around various experiments and mini-projects, each focusing on a specific area of Jetpack Compose:

- Basic layouts and UI elements.
- State management (State, ViewModels, and LiveData).
- Navigation and multi-screen apps.
- Material Design and custom theming.
- Animations and transitions.
- Interoperability with traditional XML-based UI.
